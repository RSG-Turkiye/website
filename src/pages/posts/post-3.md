This month, we're excited to feature **Dr. Ayşe Kaya**, a distinguished researcher in computational genomics and an active member of our RSG Turkey community.

## About Dr. Kaya

Dr. Kaya is an Assistant Professor at Istanbul Technical University, where she leads the Computational Genomics Laboratory. Her research focuses on understanding the genetic basis of complex diseases using advanced computational methods.

## Research Highlights

### Current Projects

1. **Cancer Genomics**: Developing machine learning algorithms to identify cancer biomarkers
2. **Population Genetics**: Studying genetic diversity in Turkish populations
3. **Drug Discovery**: Using computational methods to predict drug-target interactions

### Recent Publications

- "Machine Learning Approaches in Cancer Biomarker Discovery" (Nature Computational Science, 2023)
- "Genetic Diversity Patterns in Anatolian Populations" (PLOS Genetics, 2023)
- "Computational Drug Repurposing for Rare Diseases" (Bioinformatics, 2023)

## RSG Turkey Involvement

Dr. Kaya has been instrumental in:

- Organizing our annual symposium
- Mentoring students in computational biology
- Leading workshops on genomics analysis
- Contributing to our educational resources

## Advice for Students

> "Computational biology is a rapidly evolving field. Stay curious, keep learning new tools, and don't be afraid to collaborate. The RSG Turkey community is a great place to start building your network."

## Future Plans

Dr. Kaya is currently working on establishing a national computational biology consortium and hopes to expand RSG Turkey's international collaborations.

We're proud to have Dr. Kaya as part of our community and look forward to her continued contributions to computational biology in Turkey!
